<p>Brief summary of this use case…</p>
<div class="section" id="scientific-objective">
<h2><span class="section-number">5.2.4.1.1. </span>Scientific Objective<a class="headerlink" href="#scientific-objective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The process of seasonal forecasting with a time horizon of one to many months
(typically 6 to 9 months) poses new challenges to tools primarily developed for
weather forecasting that cover a few days. These challenges include two aspects
in particular: (1) a dramatically expanded time variable, and (2) a verification
that is by design backward oriented using extensive hindcasts over past decades
rather than the rapid verification possible in short-range weather forecasting.
Therefore, the scientific objective of the seasonal forecast usecase involves
the expansion of options to describe time as well as the strategic selection
of hindcasts.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Time:</dt><dd><p>Commonly METplus expresses time intervals in the minutes, hours, and days.
Month and year intervals were not supported since there is not a constant length for these units.
Therefore, modifications to METplus were made to support these intervals by determining the offset
relative to a given time.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Input data:</dt><dd><p>The input data from seasonal forecasts is generally based on daily, weekly, decadal
(10-day), monthly or seasonal time integrated intervals. The time variable therefore is
often no longer a simple snapshot of the system but rather representing an average, a
sum (precipitation), or a particular statistic (maximum wind, minimum temperature, wind
variability) over the integration time period. This requires some adjustment from the
traditional approach in forecast verification where forecast time (“valid-time”) is
simply a snapshot out of a continuous run.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Hindcasts:</dt><dd><p>The objective of seasonal forecasts is no longer the exact location and intensity
of one particular weather event, such as a storm, a frontal passage, or high wind
conditions. Rather, seasonal forecasting focuses more on the statistical properties
over a period of time, be it a 10-day interval, a month, or even a three month season.
The verification of a new, forward looking seasonal forecast requires assessments of
the forecast systems ability to appropriately forecast that longrange behavior of the
weather (here, only atmospheric verification is considered, but the same concept would
apply ocean or any other longrange forecast system). Because weather properties
commonly change significantly over the course of the season, samples to verify the
prognostic system can not be taken from the immediate days, weeks of months before the
forecast. Hindcasting in the seasonal context requires a complete set of forecasts
based on the same season but during past years. A current July-1 2019 forecast, therefore
requires many July-1 forecasts for as many years in the past as possible, given that
the forecast system is the same as the one used for the current forecast cycle into the
future. Operational centers offer hindcasts, also sometimes called “re-forecasts”, with
the current, most up-to-date forecast system. MET and METplus therefore need to be able
to extract the appropriate collection of past forecasts. This includes the identification
of the same Julian-day-of-Year init-dates from forecasts cycles from past years, and then
identify the different lead-times of interest generally ranging from one to 6 or more
months.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Verification:</dt><dd><p>The verification steps can then utilize the existing collection of verification tools.
In comparison to weather forecasts, the only difference is that the data, as stated
above, are not snapshots but time-integrated values (averages, sums, statistics) that
are representing a whole period of time. The verification then focuses on comparisons
of these derivatives of the forecast simulations. In practice, a further step might be
added prior to, or as a key step during verification: the formation of anomalies of the
forecasts compared to long-term expected averages. A rainfall forecasts can therefore
be verified in both absolute as well as anomaly context where some analyses might focus
on extreme rainfall threshold exeedance of, for example, 500mm per month. At the same
time, the same forecast might be verified for the 3 months rainfall average in comparison
with the long-term expected mean. The verification might then assess how well the system
can foresee the occurrence of below average rainfall over the season, and possibly some
selected thresholds there (e.g., ability to forecast mean seasonal rainfall below
the 10-th percentile of seasonal rainfall). Finally, flexibility in formulating forecast
verification strategies is important as forecast skill might vary by location, the timing
within the seasonal cycle, or the state of the evolving coupled system (the rapid onset
of a strong El Nino will lead to significantly different forecast skill compared to a
neutral state in the Pacific). Memory from past months, for example when considering
accumulated soil moisture, might also influence the forecast skills. Seasonal forecast
verification therefore requires understanding of the climate system; MET and METplus
then need to offer the flexibility to tailor verification strategies and to potentially
craft conditional approaches.</p>
<p>Overall, seasonal forecasts don’t require a new verification approach. It does however
put demands on the flexibility of dealing with a significantly exapanded range of the
time variable as well as logistic infrastructure to select appropriate hindcast samples
from long hindcast or re-forecast archives. Scientifically, the challenges are mostly
restricted in the appropriate formulation of verificaation questions that address
specific forecast objectives. Compared to weather forecastsing, seasonal forecasts need
to draw their skill from slowly changing components in the coupled Earth system while
acknowledging the high-frequency noise of weather superposed on these ‘climatologically’
evolving background conditions. In many regions of the world, the noise might dominate
that background climate and forecast skill is low. It is therefore the task of seasonal
forecast verification to identify where there is actually skill for particular properties
of the forecasts over a wide range of lead-times. The skill might be dependent on
location, on the timing within the seasonal cycle, or even on the evolving state of the
coupled system.</p>

<p>All datasets are traditionally in netCDF format. Grids are either regular gaussian
Latitude/Longitude grids or they are Lambert-conformal WRF grids.</p>
<p>The forecast datasets contain weekly, monthly or seasonally integrated data. Here, the
time format of the use-case is monthly. Since the verification is done on the hindcasts
rather than the forecast (would require another 6 months of waiting), the key
identification here is the month of initialization and then the lead-time of the forecast
of interest.</p>
<p>The hindcast data, the ‘observational’ data that is to be compared to the forecast,
is a collection of datasets formatted in equivalent format to the forecast. The
hindcast ensemble is identified through the year in the filename (as well as in the
time variable inside the netCDF file).</p>

<p>Because not all of this use case has been incorporated into the METplus wrappers framework, the application of
seasonal forecast verification is split into two steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>work with ~30-years of hindcasts to determine how well forecasting mechanisms worked
in the past. This is done using the python-wrapped tools of METplus that are ready
for automated processing using the GridStat tool.</p></li>
<li><p>select one or more verification criteria and investigate these in context of the
hindcast archive to generate a mask that then is applied to the actual forecast.
This step users StatAnalysis, an element of this use case that has not yet been configured in
the METplus wrappers, and thus it needs to be run directly under MET.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Step 1: GridStat using METplus
In order to run the python-based METplus packages, the user needs to issue a command to
activate the appropriate version of python on the system. In the virtual machine delivered
to BMKG, this is done with the following command:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>conda activate py3.6.3</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The GridStat tool is driven by the following ASCII configuration and run-scripts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>METplus: run_grid_stat_metplus.bash sets key variables and executes the
master_metplus.py with configurations. Look for …/ush/master_metplus.py call:</p></li>
<li><p>user-config: “apik.conf”: defines which met version is used, where input data is to
be found, and where output. It also provides the filters for the formats of both input
and output.</p></li>
<li><p>met_config: contains “GridStatConfig_seasonal_forecast” where it sets all the
GridStat parameters for data handling as well as types of statistics to be computed.</p></li>
<li><p>use-case config: points to the specific configuration file, in this case
“grid_to_grid_s2s_use_case_1_August-December.conf”, though a separate configuration
file for the 6th month of the example is needed because the forecast for January is
located in a file with a year parameter that is advanced over August through December.
In future versions this separation will not be necessary.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Step 2: SeriesAnalysis and StatAnalysis using MET
The SeriesAnalysis and StatAnalysis tools are core MET tools that offer analysis
capabilities based on prior processing and calculation steps. Series Analysis can
generate initial products, but it can also pickup secondary products and analyze
them in a time-series context. For the purpose of the use case, two sequential
calculations are necessary. First, a summary of each statistical quantity has to be
computed across the different hindcast cases (each of which had been processed separately
before). This includes the application of thresholds and counting of occurrences above or
below these thresholds. Then second, based on these climatologies, the full statistics
can now be computed across the collection to provide the overall skill computation
within the hindcast context.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>The following scripts define the process:</dt><dd><p>MET run script: run_sereis_analysis.bash sets all key configurations determining
input and output data, provides templates for reading variables inside the statistics
files. Because this part of the use case is not yet run via the METplus wrappers, the run-script has
to cover many aspects of the configuration that in METplus are better generalized.
SeriesAnalysis Climatology: SeriesAnalysisConfig_seasonal_forecast_climo
contains the parameters that calculate the climatological mean difference between the
hindcast experiments and their associated observations.
SeriesAnalysis 2: SeriesAnalysisConfig_seasonal_forecast_full_stats
contains all necessary configurations to compute the skill statistics. The options for
these statistics are listed in the MET-Users Guide. There are many options, and
turning them on is done in the context of the different groups or “packages”.</p>

<p>METplus sets environment variables based on the values in the METplus configuration file.
These variables are referenced in the MET configuration file. <strong>YOU SHOULD NOT SET ANY OF THESE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES YOURSELF! THEY WILL BE OVERWRITTEN BY METPLUS WHEN IT CALLS THE MET TOOLS!</strong> If there is a setting in the MET configuration file that is not controlled by an environment variable, you can add additional environment variables to be set only within the METplus environment using the [user_env_vars] section of the METplus configuration files. See the ‘User Defined Config’ section on the ‘System Configuration’ page of the METplus User’s Guide for more information.</p>

</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The former method is recommended. Whether you add them to a user-specific configuration file or modify the metplus_config files, the following variables must be set correctly:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>INPUT_BASE</strong> - Path to directory where sample data tarballs are unpacked (See Datasets section to obtain tarballs). This is not required to run METplus, but it is required to run the examples in parm/use_cases</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OUTPUT_BASE</strong> - Path where METplus output will be written. This must be in a location where you have write permissions</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MET_INSTALL_DIR</strong> - Path to location where MET is installed locally</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Example User Configuration File:</p>
